## 2. Changes to Terms & Service

We may revise these Terms and may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion. If we make material changes, we will post the revised Terms and provide at least thirty (30) days' notice before they take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 3. Eligibility & Compliance

You represent that you (a) are at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into contracts; (b) have not been previously suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and third‑party terms (including search‑engine policies) when using the Service.

## 4. License & Intellectual Property

### 4.1 Ownership

The Service and all Content (except User Contributions) are owned by Lovarank or its licensors and are protected by intellectual‑property laws.

### 4.2 Limited License

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service for your internal business purposes. No other rights are granted.

### 4.3 Trademarks

Lovarank and related marks are our proprietary trademarks. You may not use any trademarks without our prior written consent.

## 5. User Contributions

### 5.1 Responsibility

You retain ownership of, and are solely responsible for, your User Contributions.

### 5.2 License to Lovarank

By submitting any User Contribution, you grant us a worldwide, royalty‑free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, publish, display, and distribute that User Contribution in connection with operating and improving the Service.

### 5.3 Prohibited Content

You will not upload, post, or transmit any Content that: (a) infringes any third‑party right; (b) is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, harassing, or otherwise objectionable; (c) violates any search‑engine guidelines; or (d) contains viruses or other harmful code.

## 6. Acceptable Use & Prohibited Conduct

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any illegal, deceptive, or fraudulent purpose.
- Interfere with, disrupt, or impair the functioning of the Service.
- Copy, scrape, harvest, or index any Content without authorization.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any accounts, systems, or networks.
- Use automated means (including bots or scripts) to access the Service except through documented APIs we expressly make available.

## 7. Backlink Exchange Terms

### 7.1 Third‑Party Sites

Listings may reference websites operated by third parties. We do not control or endorse, and are not responsible for, any third‑party sites or their content.

### 7.2 Automated Placement & Your Responsibility

When you activate or purchase any backlink package, our system automatically creates and publishes the agreed‑upon links no manual preview or approval step is provided. Before enabling a package, make sure those links align with your own policies, brand, and risk tolerance. Because every website, search engine, and campaign is different, we cannot guarantee (a) the safety, reputation, or compliance of any third‑party site; (b) that a backlink will improve your rankings or traffic; or (c) that search‑engine algorithms or policies will remain unchanged.

### 7.3 Search‑Engine Guidelines

Search engines set and update their own rules. They may reduce visibility or penalize sites they believe use links in ways that violate those rules. By choosing to use the Backlink Exchange you accept that risk and agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any related penalties, losses, or liabilities.

### 7.4 Commitment to Best Practices

We actively monitor search‑industry trends and guidelines, and we routinely refine our automated placement systems, link sources, and quality‑control checks to align with widely accepted best practices. While these efforts are intended to reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes, no solution can eliminate all risk. Accordingly, the disclaimers and limitations of liability in Sections 10 and 11 continue to apply.

## 9. Modifications, Suspension & Termination
